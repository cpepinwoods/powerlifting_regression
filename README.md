# Powerlifting Total Prediction

This project uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to predict powerlifting totals based on lifter data from the [OpenPowerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/) dataset. It also includes a time-series analysis component to explore performance trends over time.

## Features

- **MLP Regression Model** built in Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **Time-Series Analysis** implemented in R (R Markdown)
- Data preprocessing, training, and evaluation all included
- Based on real competition data from OpenPowerlifting

## Tech Stack

- Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- R + R Markdown (for time-series modeling)

## Note

The OpenPowerlifting export is too large to be stored in this repo, but can be found easily at the above link
